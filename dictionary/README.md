Please write a couple of sentences explaining your choice of restart
strategy.
I chose :permanent as the restart strategy because other modules depend on this guy.
Without the dictionary, other modules cannot work normally.
Therefore, under no situations should the dictionary end without a restart,
even if someone shuts it down with reason :normal.
