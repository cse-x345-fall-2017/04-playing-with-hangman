Please write a couple of sentences explaining your choice of restart
strategy.



I choose permanent.
First, in dictionary_requirement_3, if a random_word exits abnormally, it will restart automatically. So we should pick transient or permanent. I think permanent is better because it helps dictionary keep working even it exits normally but actually by mistake. As along as we playing the next game, we need dictionary again. So, dictionary should never exits actually.
Another reason is, permanent is default, which means, I do not even  have to implement it.
