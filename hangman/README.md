I choose permanent as restart value.

Reason is similar with dictionary, First, both permanent and transient can help restart with abnormal exits. And also, both can be reasonable choice. transient is good because it helps exits when we do not need it, very effcient. However, in order to ensure that the exits normally but actually by mistake, It should uses permanent. Also, permanent is default.
